This mod has been rewritten and revamped by Michieal / Faerraven. Based on the code originally done by Zeg9, and then
heavily modified by the Mineclone 2 dev team.

This mod now supports all the base item frame functions, like rotating the displayed item, which it didn't do before it
was rewritten. Additionally, Glow Frames have been added in, and item frames now has an API to allow new item frames to
be created in other modules.
Now requires the Screwdriver to have full functionality.

The code is licenced under the standard MineClone 2 license for usage, with the requirement that this readme is
included in the code / module.
