End Portal=
An End portal teleports creatures and objects to the mysterious End dimension (and back!).=
Hop into the portal to teleport. Entering an End portal in the Overworld teleports you to a fixed position in the End dimension and creates a 5Ã—5 obsidian platform at your destination. End portals in the End will lead back to your spawn point in the Overworld.=
End Portal Frame=
End portal frames are used in the construction of End portals. Each block has a socket for an eye of ender.=
NOTE: The End dimension is currently incomplete and might change in future versions.=
End Portal Frame with Eye of Ender=
Nether Portal=
A Nether portal teleports creatures and objects to the hot and dangerous Nether dimension (and back!). Enter at your own risk!=
Stand in the portal for a moment to activate the teleportation. Entering a Nether portal for the first time will also create a new portal in the other dimension. If a Nether portal has been built in the Nether, it will lead to the Overworld. A Nether portal is destroyed if the any of the obsidian which surrounds it is destroyed, or if it was caught in an explosion.=
Obsidian is also used as the frame of Nether portals.=
To open a Nether portal, place an upright frame of obsidian with a width of at least 4 blocks and a height of 5 blocks, leaving only air in the center. After placing this frame, light a fire in the obsidian frame. Nether portals only work in the Overworld and the Nether.=
Once placed, an eye of ender can not be taken back.=
